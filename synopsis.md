# Project Title: Digital Menu & Ordering Platform for Restaurants

## Problem Statement

- **Lengthy Service Times:** Traditional restaurant operations suffer from lengthy service times, averaging 15-20 minutes per menu handling, leading to operational inefficiencies.

- **Pandemic-Driven Need:** The COVID-19 pandemic necessitates the adoption of contactless dining solutions for safety, requiring a fundamental shift in restaurant operations.

- **Outdated Traditional Menus:**
  1. **Difficulty in Updating Menus:** Traditional menus are hard to change and update, making it challenging for restaurants to accommodate seasonal offerings, promotions, or changes in pricing.

  2. **Lack of Real-time Updates:** Traditional menus lack real-time updates, resulting in instances where customers may be disappointed when their preferred dishes are no longer available due to lack of synchronization with kitchen inventory.

  3. **Paper-Based Menus:** Many restaurants still make use of paper menus, which are not only environmentally unfriendly but also prone to damage and wear and tear.

## Rationale for Topic Selection

The chosen topic addresses the urgent need for a transformative dining experience that streamlines restaurant operations, making them more efficient and customer-centric. Moreover, it responds to the pandemic with technology-driven contactless dining solutions, ensuring the safety of both customers and staff. Additionally, this project aims to incorporate cutting-edge AI features, including a recommendation system and a chatbot, to enhance user engagement and satisfaction.

## Objectives and Scope

### Objectives

1. Develop an extensive digital menu and ordering platform that offers a holistic dining experience.

2. Enable various dining options, including dine-in, takeout, and pre-scheduled dine-in orders, with options for customization, table reservations, secure payments, and real-time updates.

3. Create a user-friendly website with an intuitive frontend and a robust backend system using the MEAN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, Angular, and Node.js).

4. Integration of AI features, including a recommendation system and a chatbot, to provide personalized dining experiences and improve overall user engagement.

### Scope

The project scope encompasses:

- Designing and implementing a user-friendly website with a responsive frontend for different devices.

- Developing a secure and scalable backend using MongoDB, Express.js, Angular, and Node.js to handle user requests, orders, and payments.

- Integrating industry-standard APIs for secure payment processing, ensuring the safety of financial transactions.

- Implementing AI algorithms for recommendation and chatbot functionalities, which require a dedicated AI server with a minimum of 16GB RAM and a quad-core CPU.

## User Interface

- **Customer UI:** The customer interface will be available as both a mobile app and a website, ensuring flexibility and convenience for users. Customers can access the platform using their preferred device, making the digital menu and ordering experience accessible and user-friendly.

- **Restaurant UI:** While customers will primarily interact with the platform through the mobile app and website, the restaurant interface will be predominantly web-based. This web-based interface will allow restaurant staff to manage orders, view real-time updates, and make necessary adjustments to the menu. This approach ensures that restaurant operations are streamlined and efficient, as staff can access the platform through a computer or tablet within the restaurant.

## Methodology

The project will follow an Agile development approach to facilitate iterative improvements over a 12-month timeline. This methodology allows for flexibility and adaptability, essential for addressing evolving customer needs and emerging technologies. The development process will involve:

- Utilizing MEAN stack technologies for web development, ensuring a seamless user experience.

- Incorporating industry-standard APIs for secure payments, prioritizing the safety of financial transactions and data.

- Leveraging AI features to provide personalized recommendations and interactive chatbot assistance, enhancing user engagement and satisfaction.

## Hardware & Software

### Hardware

- **Web Servers:** Dedicated web servers will be employed for hosting the platform, equipped with a minimum of 32GB RAM, dual quad-core CPUs, and SSD storage for optimal performance.

- **AI Server:** An AI server with a minimum of 16GB RAM and a quad-core CPU will be utilized to run the recommendation system and chatbot functionalities efficiently.

### Software

- **Database:** MongoDB will be used as the database management system to store and retrieve data efficiently.

- **Backend:** Express.js will be employed for the backend development, handling user requests and managing data.

- **Frontend:** Angular will be used for creating a responsive and user-friendly frontend interface.

- **Server-Side Scripting:** Node.js will be utilized for server-side scripting, ensuring smooth communication between the frontend and backend.

## Testing Technologies

The testing process will employ a combination of manual and automated testing methodologies to ensure the platform's robustness, security, and performance. Testing technologies include:

- **Automated Testing Frameworks:** Tools like Selenium will be used for functionality, security, and performance testing, ensuring that the platform functions flawlessly under various conditions.

- **Dedicated Test Server:** A dedicated test server with 16GB RAM and a quad-core CPU will be used to execute automated tests and evaluate system performance.

- **User Acceptance Testing:** Real-world users will participate in user acceptance testing to provide valuable feedback and identify any usability issues.

## Project Contribution

This project aims to make several significant contributions:

- **Revolutionizing the Restaurant Industry:** By offering a comprehensive digital menu and ordering platform, the project seeks to revolutionize the restaurant industry, making it more customer-centric and operationally efficient through the use of the MEAN stack.

- **Promoting Contactless Dining:** The platform will promote contactless dining, customization, convenience, and potentially increased revenue for restaurants by providing a safe and convenient dining experience.

- **Addressing Safety Concerns:** In the midst of the pandemic, this project aims to address safety concerns by fostering a hygienic and satisfying dining environment through contactless solutions.

- **Utilizing AI:** The incorporation of AI features like recommendation systems and chatbots acknowledges the ubiquity of AI in modern websites, enhancing the overall user experience and operational efficiency, even in features such as map integration.
